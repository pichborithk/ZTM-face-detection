# Face-Detection
## Introduction

This is the final project for the Zero to Mastery: Web Developer 2022 course. This project is a Front-End, single page application built with React.

## Features

- React: This project uses React for the Front-End.
- Single page application: The entire application is built as a single page, allowing for a smooth and seamless user experience.
- API: This project connects to a Back-End API in order to retrieve and display data.

## Requirements

In order for this app to function properly, you will need to have the Back-End project running on your local machine first before run this project. Please visit this link for BackEnd project: https://github.com/pichborithk/face-detection-api

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
4. Run npm start to start the development server.

## Note
Again, this Front-End app is designed to work with the accompanying Back-End project, so make sure to set that up and have it running before attempting to use this app.
